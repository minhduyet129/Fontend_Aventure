    <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects </h2>
    <p>When Riya was on the way home from school one day, she heard some people nearby talking. One of them said,” It is
      so sad seeing our natural environment change. All the trees will be cut down.” Riya quickly looked at her mother
      and asked, ” What is a natural environment, mother?”. “Everything around us that is not human-made is our natural
      environment”, said her mother. Riya was confused. Let’s help Riya understand what natural and human-made
      environments are.Our environment is everything that surrounds us- from the trees, mountains, roads, buildings,
      things and even people. It is a combination of both natural and human-made elements. These elements are divided
      into two types: Biotic and Abiotic. Biotic elements are all the living organisms. Abiotic elements include all the
      non-living things.Everything that is not human-made comes under natural environment. Land, air, water, plants and
      animals all comprise the natural environment. Let us learn about the different domains of the natural environment.
      These are the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere.What is an ecosystem? All plants, animals and
      human beings depend on each other. The relation between living organisms, as well as the relation between living
      organisms and their environment, form an ecosystem. An ocean is an example of an ecosystem because it comprises of
      living organisms, land, air ( in dissolved form) and water of course
